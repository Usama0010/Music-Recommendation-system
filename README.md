# Music-Recommendation-system
Spotifyâ€™s music recommendation system is powered by machine learning algorithms that analyse user behaviour, preferences, and listening habits to generate personalised recommendations. These algorithms consider factors such as the songs users listen to, how often they listen, playlists they create, and artists they follow.
